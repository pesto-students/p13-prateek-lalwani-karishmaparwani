        <div>I'm Nobody! Who are you?</div>
        <div> you - Nobody - Too? </div>
        <div>Then there's a pair of us! </div>
        <div>Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</div>

    <p>
        <div> dreary - to be - Somebody!</div>
        <div>How public - like a Frog -</div>
        <div>To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!</div>
